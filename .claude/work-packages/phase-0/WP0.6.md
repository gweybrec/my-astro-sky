### WP0.6 — Results and go/no-go

- A Sonnet subagent drafts `docs/dev/mobile/spike-results.md` from the JSON results: one table per spike, per device.
- The Planner (Opus) reads only that draft and writes the decisions: catalog format, HTTP approach, image size limits, photo-layer feasibility, adapter rules. It adjusts the Phase 1–4 cards if needed.
- The docs row for the new file is added to `docs/CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Commits

- `CLAUDE.md` forbids committing without your explicit permission. **You gave it on 2026-10-03: commits are allowed on the new branches only.**
  That means the `mobile/*` and `spike/*` branches created from `dev` for this work. Never on `master` or `dev`. Never push.
- **One commit per card**, made by the worker when its acceptance passes, with files staged by explicit path.
- Before committing, the worker checks `git branch --show-current`. If it is not a `mobile/*` or `spike/*` branch, it stops and reports.
- Message format: Conventional Commits. Use `internal(refactor): …` for moves and plumbing, `internal(mobile): …` for spikes.
- **Never add a `Co-Authored-By` line or any AI attribution.** The root `CLAUDE.md` forbids it, and that rule overrides the harness default.
- Never push.

## Always forbidden

- Do not start a dev server. Do not kill any process.
- Do not install SDK packages, emulators, AVDs or system images. Do not run sdkmanager or avdmanager.
- Do not push. Do not add Co-Authored-By or any AI attribution.
- Do not switch branch. Do not use `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git clean`, `git stash` or `git reset --hard`.
- Do not touch untracked files that you did not create.
